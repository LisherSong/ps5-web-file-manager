/* zipx_volstream -- present a multi-file archive volume set as one stream.
   part of ps5-web-file-manager

   Two split layouts exist in the wild and they need different behaviour:

   ZIPX_VOL_MODE_CONCAT (byte split)
     `name.zip.001`, `name.zip.002`, ... (7-Zip) and `name.part1.zip`,
     `name.part2.zip` (WinRAR). Each part is a byte slice of one archive, so
     byte N of the logical archive is byte N of the concatenation and every
     offset stored inside the archive is already absolute. Offsets are passed
     through untouched and the disk properties are reported as unsupported so
     minizip-ng keeps using absolute offsets.

   ZIPX_VOL_MODE_DISK (zip split disks)
     `name.z01`, `name.z02`, ..., `name.zip` (Info-ZIP / PKZIP style). The
     central directory stores the offset of a local header relative to the
     disk it starts on, so minizip-ng switches the active disk through
     MZ_STREAM_PROP_DISK_NUMBER before seeking. Seek/tell are relative to the
     active disk here, which is exactly what mz_zip_entry_seek_local_header
     expects, and the stream starts on the last disk because that is where the
     end-of-central-directory record lives. */
