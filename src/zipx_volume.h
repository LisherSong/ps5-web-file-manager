/* zipx_volume -- group a multi-file archive volume set into an ordered list.
   part of ps5-web-file-manager

   Supports the naming conventions seen in the wild:

     name.zip.001, name.zip.002, ...   byte split (7-Zip "split to volumes")
     name.part1.zip, name.part2.zip    byte split (WinRAR zip volumes)
     name.z01, name.z02, ..., name.zip zip split disks (Info-ZIP / PKZIP)

   A caller can hand in any member of the set (the user usually clicks one file
   in the browser) and gets back the full ordered list plus the split layout so
   the engine can pick the matching stream behaviour. */
