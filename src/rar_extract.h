/* Safe RAR extraction engine used by the /api/extract task.
   Wraps the vendored rarlab UnRAR 7.20.1 (third_party/unrar7) through its
   C-compatible DLL API (unrar_c_api.h facade).

   Reuses the zip_extract types so the dispatch layer can call either engine
   through the same status / limits / progress protocol.

   See zip_extract.h for the shared limits, conflict, progress and result types.

   Backend notes (v1.9, unrar 7.20.1):
     * RAR4 and RAR5, any compression version including WinRAR 6/7 "v6".
     * Multi-volume: unrar merges next .partNN.rar by name automatically.
     * Encrypted RAR is NOT yet supported end-to-end: the engine can decrypt
       via RARSetPassword, but password plumbing (API + UI) is unwired, so
       encrypted headers/entries fail with ZIPX_ERR_UNSUPPORTED today.

   See third_party/unrar7/VENDORED.md for full integration notes. */
